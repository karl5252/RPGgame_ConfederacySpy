WPF & .NET based
Data stored using serialized file (.sav, .cfg)
Data loaded into the game using serialized file (xml)
game map loaded using *.xlsx  into engine as an two-dimensional array
each coordinate will have a special event assigned. 
special event can be merchant, collectible, enemy encounter, gate (need a special item to went through)
global random events (few that change difficulty dynamics eg Refugee influx-> reduces Defeat Points by int n value due to straining CorSec processing capability; Republic Propaganda success-> harder to keep low profile-> increase of Defeat Points by int n value)
*cinematics for random events?
character wil have few special characteristics like attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Endurance, Luck.
Attack value will be calculated using weapon base attack range (random number from range) and STR attribiute
Defensive value will be calculated using armor/ clothing base  value and Endurance

Lower level encounter enemy might be a drug dealer ("wanna some deathstikzz?") or a thug. Highest level encounter will be specialised ARC cloned trooper(s).
Point is to scout map for useful information that will be a randomized loot from enemies, or can be bought fromcertain merchants (infobroker) or gatheredas 100% chance from 'boss'enemies.
Idea torethink is to add 'diversion' capability that can at random increase or decrease 'visibility'of the spy and at random produce valuable intel.

There will be approx 5-10 races of aliens to choose with special ability each giving a permament boost eg Clawdithe spy will start with minus value Defeat Points due to it`s shapeshifting ability allowing such spy to remain undetected for far longer.
turn based  gameplay

One of game conditions is victory- defeat points. VIctory points are earned by gaining "intel" defeat points are growing over time. Mechanic is toprevent player for repeateing encounters for too long  and grow too powerful.
